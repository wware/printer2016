Printer 2016
====

The idea here is to do something like the 2014 printer, except:

* Replace the orange bucket with a 5-gallon aquarium
    * http://www.walmart.com/ip/GloFish-5-Gallon-Aquarium-Kit-Fish-Aquatic-Pets/29114303
* Replace the bicycle chain with multiple NEMA-17 steppers
* Replace plywood with threaded-rod-and-printed-block construction.
